    <p> One of my favorite trips in the past few years was when I went on a solo trip to Vietnam in November of 2023.
        This was my first trip to Asia, and my first time on a 14 hour flight.
        I was able to try different Vietnamese foods like Bahn mi and Pho, as well as visit historic museums.
        The weather was sunny and warm. I enjoyed the trip very much! </p>

    <p> I enjoy this restaurant because it has authentic Peruvian food. I love eating "arroz chaufa" which is Peruvian-Chinese fusion style fried rice.
        I also enjoy the different drinks they have such as Pisco Sour, one of Peru's most famous cocktails. The staff are friendly and there is always
        space, never any long waits. Great place to try some new latin foods!

            My favorite food is lasagna. I love eating beef lasagna hot, with the cheese still melting. 
            I like to eat lasagna with some salad on the side and a piece of garlic bread. I'd pair it with a Sprite.
